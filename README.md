## House Job Tracker
This project is designed to assist in tracking house jobs for the house that I live in.
The user is able to add, edit or clear house jobs for both days of the week on which they are done.
The app seeks to keep house job assignmetn organized to reduce the possibility of people forgetting or not being able to find out they're own house job
Further development is needed for the app to be useful for more than a personal record of house jobs, as it does not have persistent storage.
